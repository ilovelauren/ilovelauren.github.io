                <p >I picked Call Of Duty black ops 3 as my top rated game because I played every cod since i was younger. I also picked this as my top rated game because i use to win money from playing call of duty. i use to win money by versing competitve gamers on different websites and use to enter tournaments. it really interest me because it makes me feel as if i was in the army.</p>

                      <p >Clash of Clans is my second rated game because of alot of reasons. One of these reasons is because you can chat and play at the same time. This is good because while you're playing, you can take advice from other people. Another reason i like this game is because its not violent, and just a different game from every other game i play. Lastly, i like this because the game pushes me to play more because once you upgrade, you unlock new things and it just gets even better.</p>

                            <p>I pick NFL 16 as my third favorite. I pick this because football is my favorite sport. I love it, because it makes me feel as though im playing the game. it alows me to control all the players. I also like the different game modes that the game allows you to play. There is season mode, and you can create your own player and pick a team you want to be on.</p>

                            <h2 class="featurette-heading">NBA 2K16<span class="text-muted"></span></h2>
                            <p>I said NBA 2k16, is my 2nd least favorite game out of the top 5 because nba use to be so boring, but this game is really good. I say this because NBA2k16 is no longer a game where one team simply plays another. Now, games can actually create their own player. Once you make a rookie player better by MyCareer games, you are then ready to face the world. This is my favorite part, and the main reason why I really like this game. you can take your own player to the parks, and compete against other people just like you do in real life. Overall, NBA2K16 has really improved the game this year.</p>

                            <h2 class="featurette-heading">GTA V <span class="text-muted"></span></h2>
                            <p class="lead"></p> I picked GTA V on my top 5 because it really has improved itself. I say this because the missions are awesome. Ive played this game more in a week then I ever played all of them in general. I say it is so good because its like Call of duty but in gta. You can play with your friends online and meet up with each other to kill other gangs. It is also cool, because you can do alot of missions and make money to buy your own house and car. The graphics itself are amazing, and the story plot is great.
